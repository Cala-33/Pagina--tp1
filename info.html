            <p>Welcome to <k style="color: #F8B71D;">By Tarantino</k>! Step into a digital time machine that’s all about the golden age of cinema, wrapped up in the nostalgic feel of an old-school VHS box. This site is a throwback to when movies were rewound and replayed until the tape wore thin, and Tarantino's films were the ones you couldn’t wait to pop into the VCR. We’ve recreated that retro vibe, with everything from grainy visuals to the classic box art design, giving you a space that feels like your favorite video store’s hidden gem. Here, the magic of Tarantino comes alive just like it did the first time you hit play.</p>
